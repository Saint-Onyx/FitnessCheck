Used Version: Unity 2019.1.7f1 Personal
Creator: Daniel Jazz Young

The program has disabled features which were not required
for the user study and may look strange if the tracking
has not been set up properly.
To enable tracking and recording movements, set the 
following gameobjects as active:

[CameraRig]
Dummy
StopButton
RecordButton
Targets
Bend Goals

Deactivate Replay Parent or the second avatar will still
play animations.
